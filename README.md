# The Old Reader Makeup

Chrome extension withe opinionated styling for RSS-reader ["The Old Reader"](https://theoldreader.com/). Makes it easier to read with fixed width for content and fixed padding and margins.

For content styling I have used [Tailwind Typograhpy](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography) prose default.
